# JSXGraph Example JessieCode

##  Symbolic Differentiation
In these examples the function `js.manipulate` was used to the derivatives in a symbolic way. The examples are part of the talk **[Examples using the CAS of JSXGraph](https://jsxgraph.org/conf2024/program/rathmann/)** held at the **[JSXGraph2024](https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/conf2024/)**
